# Projects

Here we present the documentation for each project developed by **LADETEC**. The general structure of the documentation under a given project is divided in two main folders: **Documentation** and **Developer**. Under the **Documentation** taxonomy we describe the software functinalaities from a user perspective. On the other hand, under the **Developer** taxonomy, code documentation is discused.
